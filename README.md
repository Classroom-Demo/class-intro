# Welcome to CS-9999!

I'm excited that you've decided to embark on this journey with me.

--- 

For your first assignment, please create a new branch titled `<yourFirstName-yourLastName>`

I'd like to learn more about you as we get started with quanto-mecanical-nexus-cloud computing. 

Please add the following to the file. 

- [ ] Your Major
- [ ] Tell me about an app you've built
- [ ] Your favorite Steve Jobs quote
- [ ] What you hope to get out of this class

Commit this file to your new branch, and create a new Pull Request to merge this branch into Master.

After this, I will be able to review and grade your submission.
